<h1>GuessMaster Game</h1>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
This game allows users to guess the birthday of a named entity, e.g., a
celebrity, country, or prominent leader. This requires a human player trying to guess
the correct birthday, that is held secretly in the computer program (e.g. Justin Trudeau
was born on December 25, 1971).
To start, the program welcomes the human player and informs them whose birthday
to guess. More specifically, from a set of entities saved or hard-coded in the program, the
program randomly picks one entity (e.g., a celebrity or country), prints the name on the
screen, and asks the user to guess the entityâ€™s birth date. The user guesses until they guess the correct date.
